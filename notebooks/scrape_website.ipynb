I would get lots of connections but the tricky part was always getting the conversation going. Rocketbrew's personalized messages are the difference between sales activity and sales outcomes.\"I never respond to outreachbut IÂ responded to Rocketbrew.\"I heard about Rocketbrew from an outreach message from the team. It was by far the best cold outreach message I had ever received, and I didn't believe it was written by AI. Now, I've fine-tuned Rocketbrew to my own use cases, and letting the tool do its magic.Javier LuraschiCEO, Hal9\"Night and day difference between Rocketbrew and templated messages.\"Before Rocketbrew, I focused on prioritizing volume by sending templated messages, but I would send thousands with few responses. With Rocketbrew, I can maintain a level of personalization and creative touch with every message I send. It's honestly like having 3 extra players on my team to help craft genuine messages.Peter JurisicCEO, Budee\"If you can close calls, but struggle to open them, you need Rocketbrew.\"Reaching out to Fortune 500 companies is not easy. My team can close calls no problem, but getting our foot through the door was where we needed help and Rocketbrew has stepped in big time. We've gotten over 30 conversations in a month with Fortune 500 decision makers, all of them initiated by Rocketbrew's hyper-personalized and well-researched messaging.Amit HasakCEO, Transship\"Scale your outreach without having to scale your team.\"The best tool for managing your team's outbound. With Rocketbrew, I can manage our entire team's accounts to scale our outreach, easily sending messages and responses from multiple accounts within one platform. The personalization can also be tuned per account, making the messages stand out and saving me soooooo much time.Chris RichaBD, StudioAccelerate your outbound, without adding headcount.Build pipelineAdd up to 15 incremental calls per rep, each month.Drive engagementConvert 33% of connections to conversations.Expand capacitySave up to 168 hours per rep, each month.TryRocketbrewfor FreeNo fuss, no muss.Get started nowTest messaging within the first 15 minutesFree hands-on onboarding & supportBecome a sales godteam@loverocketbrew.comResourcesContact UsBlogsWhat data to use for personalizationKey elements of an A+ value propositionDocumentationSecurity &Â TrustSales and CRMÂ IntegrationsHow to Set Up DNS Records & Email AuthÂ© All rights reserved.Privacy PolicyTerms & Conditions\n"
